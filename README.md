# Subscribers Plugin #

## Description ##

The plugin provides three pages, which are added to the Subscribers menu:

* subscriber attributes - shows each subscriber with attributes, and confirmed and blacklisted status
* subscriber history - shows history events: all, since a start date or those containing specific text
* subscriptions - lists the number of subscriptions and unsubscriptions for each month with a chart showing the data graphically

## Installation ##

### Dependencies ###

Requires php version 5.2 or later.

Requires the Common Plugin to be installed. 

See <https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-common>

### Set the plugin directory ###
You can use a directory outside of the web root by changing the definition of `PLUGIN_ROOTDIR` in config.php.
The benefit of this is that plugins will not be affected when you upgrade phplist.

### Install through phplist ###
Install on the Plugins page (menu Config > Plugins) using the package URL `https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-subscribers/archive/master.zip`.

### Install manually ###
Download the plugin zip file from <https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-subscribers/archive/master.zip>

Expand the zip file, then copy the contents of the plugins directory to your phplist plugins directory.
This should contain

* the file SubscribersPlugin.php
* the directory SubscribersPlugin
